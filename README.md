A webapp to quickly check mobile data plan limit. Polish providers only

Now (3.2019) is the live testing phase, avaliable @ http://amateusz.pythonanywhere.com/

A simple service enabling quick checking of a mobile data plan limit.
This is a initial version of the app and it is aimed solely at the polish "market" thus only polish mobile operators are supported and there is no translation…

flask + some reverse-engineered per-operator modules.
